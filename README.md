# Ludo_dice
I have a made Ludo dice by using VS code, Python and for GUI I have used tkinter package
It will show a single dice with random number, "once the roll dice" button is clicked 
but if you got 6 it will show message "You got another chance to roll", this message will only pop's up if you got 6.
